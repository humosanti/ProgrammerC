/* Write a program that will read five values from the keyboard and store
* them in an array of type float with the name amounts. Create two arrays of five
* elements of type long with the name dollars and cents. Store the whole number
* part of each value in the amounts array in the corresponding element of
* dollars and the fractional part of the amounts as a two-digit integer in
* cents (e.g., 2.75 in amounts[1] would result in 2 being stored in dollars[1]
* and 75 being stored in cents[1]). Output the values from the two arrays of
* type long as monetary amounts (e.g.,$2.75)
